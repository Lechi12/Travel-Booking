        <h3>1. Choose the Right Bag</h3>
        <p>
          A carry-on suitcase or a backpack is ideal for short trips. Make sure
          itâ€™s lightweight and has enough compartments.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Plan Your Outfits</h3>
        <p>
          Stick to a color scheme so you can mix and match easily. Choose
          lightweight, wrinkle-free fabrics.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Use Packing Cubes</h3>
        <p>
          Packing cubes help keep your items organized and save space in your
          luggage.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Minimize Toiletries</h3>
        <p>
          Bring travel-sized toiletries or rely on hotel-provided essentials.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Wear Your Bulkiest Items</h3>
        <p>
          If you're bringing a jacket or boots, wear them on the plane to save
          space in your bag.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Keep Essentials in Your Personal Bag</h3>
        <p>
          Important documents, medications, and electronics should always be in
          your carry-on.
